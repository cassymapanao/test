                        <h3>Happy 8th Monthsary po!! üíó</h3><br>
                        I just wanted to do something more fun for our 8th monthsary so I decided to make this. I know you'll probably say na hindi ko naman need na gawin to but I insist. I wanna put efforts on our monthsary, and syempre this is also a practice for me since may subject tayo na ganito HAHAHAHA <br><br>

                        Anyways, I wanted to express my gratitude and love for you in means that I know and I'm capable of doing. I'm fully aware that this is nothing in comparison to those na bongga yung websites, and I apologize if I ever did not meet your expectations. To be honest this is a rush work, and I'm aware that I should be making excuses, but I tried my best in making this so I hope that you will love it ü•∫ <br><br>

                        Firstly, I wanna say thank you for everything that you have done for me. You never left me despite having a messed up and unstable mental state. Lagi mo na pinaparamdam sakin na nandiyan ka lang kahit na sa mga panahon na hindi na tayo nagkakasundo or nagkaka-intindihan. You never failed to make me realized how precious I am to you and you would do anything just to be with me and stay with me until the end of time. For me, that's the most romatic thing a man could ever do to his woman. Thank you rin po kasi I can always count on you and run to you when things get tough and I end up being a whole lot of mess. You would always tell me na I don't have to be sorry, and I will never be a burden to you that I can always run to you whenever I needed you, and that shit is one of the things that I love about you. <br><br>

                        Secondly, I wanted to thank you for being my safe place. You showed me that there's peace within the sea of crowds, and that peace is something I could only achieve in your arms. With you I feel safe and contented, na I will never be judged by anyone because their opinions don't matter anymore. With you, I can be myself and let my guard down. If there's one thing I wanna experience again in another life, that one thing is to be with you again and again. <br><br>

                        Thirdly, I wanna express how grateful I am that I am able to experience a lot of my firsts with you. I admit na I never explored this wonderful world before I met you because I thought na if I will ever experience something wonderful in my life, I wanna experience it with the person that I love and spend the rest of my life with, and that person is you. I never loved you just because of the things you own, but I love you because of who you are. Some people often joke about me saying yes to you kasi may kaya ka, may sasakyan ka, tsaka kung ano ano pa, but those things aren't true. I love you because you're you, and you never acted like anyone else in front of me. You stayed true and genuine with me and never get scared of being your true self in front of me. To be honest bonus points na nga lang yung looks mo kasi husband material ka na üòç <br><br>

                        Lastly, I wanted to say thank you for being the best boyfriend in the world. I know na we still have a long way to go, pero we already encounterd different hardships and experienced different success and failure in a span of 8 months being together, and 15 months of knowing each other. We laugh, we suffer together, we argue, we communicate, we forgive, and we love each other, and that's the thing I cherish about us. At first, I thought that even a little misunderstanding can break us apart, but now I understand that nothing can separate us. I don't wanna see you with someone else, and I don't wanna be with someone else. <br><br>

                        <h4>You are my first, and you will be my last. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you and not with anyone alse.</h4><br><br>

                        <h3><strong>I love you in every universe, my love</strong></h3><br><br><br>
